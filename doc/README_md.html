<p>Build forms that allow a user to create and edit a given resource and its

</li></ol>

<h2 id="label-Introduction">Introduction<span><a href="#label-Introduction">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>As the relationships we build between our models grow and become more
complex, we need to build ways for our users to interact with those models
in all of their complexity. If a genre has many songs, then a user should
be able to create a new song <em>and</em> select from a list of existing
genres and/or create a new genre to be associated with that song, all at
the same time. In other words, if our models are associated in a certain
way, our users should be able to create and edit instances of those models
in ways that reflect those associations.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, we&#39;ll have to build forms that allow for a
user to create and edit not just the given object but any and all objects
that are associated with it.</p>

<h2 id="label-Overview">Overview<span><a href="#label-Overview">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p><strong>This is a walk-through with some extra challenges for you to
complete on your own. There are tests, so be sure to run the tests to make
sure you&#39;re following along correctly. To follow along, use
<code>shotgun</code> to start your app and visit URLs/fill out forms as
instructed.</strong> In this walk-through, we&#39;re dealing with a pet
domain model. We have an <code>Owner</code> model and a <code>Pet</code>
model. An owner has many pets, and a pet belongs to an owner. We&#39;ve
already built the migrations, models, and some controller actions and
views. Fork and clone this lab to follow along.</p>

<p>Because an owner can have many pets, we want to be able to choose which of
the existing pets in our database to associate to a new owner <em>when the
owner is being created</em>. We also want to be able to create a new pet
<em>and associate it with the owner being created</em>. So, our form for a
new owner must contain a way to select a number of existing pets to
associate with that owner as well as a way to create a brand new pet to
associate with that owner. The same is true of editing a given owner: we
should be able to select and deselect existing pets and/or create a new pet
to associate with the owner.</p>

<p>Here, we&#39;ll be taking a look together at the code that will implement
this functionality. Then, you&#39;ll build out the same feature for
creating/editing new pets.</p>

<h2 id="label-Instructions">Instructions<span><a href="#label-Instructions">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<h3 id="label-Before+You+Begin">Before You Begin<span><a href="#label-Before+You+Begin">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Since we&#39;ve provided you with much of the code for this project, take a
few moments to go through the provided files and familiarize yourself with
the app. Note that an owner has a name and has many pets and a pet has a
name and belongs to an owner. Note that we have two separate controllers,
one for pets and one for owners, each of which inherit from the main
application controller. Note that each controller has a set of routes that
enable the basic CRUD actions (except for delete –– we don&#39;t really
care about deleting for the purposes of this exercise).</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you run <code>rake db:migrate</code> and <code>rake
db:seed</code> before you move on</strong>. This will migrate our database
and seed it with one owner and two pets to get us started.</p>

<h4 id="label-A+Note+on+Seed+Files">A Note on Seed Files<span><a href="#label-A+Note+on+Seed+Files">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h4>

<p>The phrase &#39;seeding the database&#39; refers to the practice of filling
up your database with some dummy data. As we develop our apps, it is
essential that we have some data to work with. Otherwise, we won&#39;t be
able to tell if our app is working or try out the actions and features that
we are building. Sinatra makes it easy for us to seed our database by
providing us with something called a seed file. This file should be placed
in the <code>db</code> directory, <code>db/seeds.rb</code>. The seed file
is where you can write code that creates and saves instances of your
models.</p>

<p>When you run the seed task provided by Sinatra and Rake, <code>rake
db:seed</code>, the code in the seed file will be executed, inserting some
sample data into your database.</p>

<p>Go ahead and open up the seed file in this app, <code>db/seeds.rb</code>.
You should see the following:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment"># Add seed data here. Seed your database with `rake db:seed`</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">sophie</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span><span class="ruby-operator">:</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Sophie&quot;</span>)
<span class="ruby-constant">Pet</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span><span class="ruby-operator">:</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Maddy&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-identifier">owner</span><span class="ruby-operator">:</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">sophie</span>)
<span class="ruby-constant">Pet</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span><span class="ruby-operator">:</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Nona&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-identifier">owner</span><span class="ruby-operator">:</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">sophie</span>)
</pre>

<p>This is code you should be pretty familiar with by now. We are simply
creating and saving an instance of our <code>Owner</code> class and
creating and saving two new instances of the <code>Pet</code> class.</p>

<p>So, when <code>rake db:seed</code> is run, the code in this file is
actually executed, inserting the data regarding Sophie, Maddy, and Nona
into our database.</p>

<p>You can write code to seed your database in any number of ways. We&#39;ve
done it fairly simply here, but you could imagine writing code in your seed
file that sends a request to an external API and instantiates and saves
instances of a class using the response from the API. You could also write
code that opens a directory of files and uses information about each file
to create and save instances of a class. The list goes on.</p>

<h3 id="label-Creating+a+New+Owner+and+Their+Associated+Pets">Creating a New <a href="Owner.html">Owner</a> and Their Associated Pets<span><a href="#label-Creating+a+New+Owner+and+Their+Associated+Pets">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Open up <code>app/views/owners/new.erb</code> and you should see the
following code:</p>

<pre>&lt;h1&gt;Create a new Owner&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;form action=&quot;/owners&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;owner[name]&quot; id=&quot;owner_name&quot;&gt;

  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Create Owner&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>

<p>Here we have a basic form for a new owner with a field for that new
owner&#39;s name. However, we want our users to be able to create an owner
and select existing pets to associate with that new owner <em>at the same
time</em>. So, our form should include a list of checkboxes, one for each
existing pet, for our user to select from at will.</p>

<p>How can we dynamically, or programmatically, generate a list of checkboxes
for all of the pets that are currently in our database?</p>

<h4 id="label-Dynamically+Generating+Checkboxes">Dynamically Generating Checkboxes<span><a href="#label-Dynamically+Generating+Checkboxes">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h4>

<p>In order to dynamically generate these checkboxes, we need to load up all
of the pets from the database. Then, we can iterate over them in our
<code>owners/new.erb</code> view using ERB tags to inject each pet&#39;s
information into a checkbox form element. Let&#39;s take a look:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment"># controllers/owners_controller.rb</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">get</span> <span class="ruby-string">&#39;/owners/new&#39;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-ivar">@pets</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Pet</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">all</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">erb</span> :<span class="ruby-string">&#39;owners/new&#39;</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<pre># views/owners/new.erb
&lt;%@pets.each do |pet|%&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;owner[pet_ids][]&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%=pet.id%&gt;&quot; id=&quot;&lt;%=pet.id%&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;%=pet.name%&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;%end%&gt;</pre>

<p>Let&#39;s break this down:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>We use ERB to get all of the pets with <code>Pet.all</code>, then we
iterate over that collection of <code>Pet</code> objects and generate a
checkbox for each pet.</p>
</li><li>
<p>That checkbox has a <code>name</code> of
<code>&quot;owner[pet_ids][]&quot;</code> because we want to structure our
<code>params</code> hash such that the array of pet IDs is stored inside
the <code>&quot;owner&quot;</code> hash. We are aiming to associate the
pets that have these IDs with the new owner.</p>
</li><li>
<p>We give the checkbox a <code>value</code> of the given pet&#39;s ID. This
way, when that checkbox is selected, its value, i.e., the pet&#39;s ID, is
what gets sent through to the <code>params</code> hash.</p>
</li><li>
<p>We give the checkbox an <code>id</code> of the given pet&#39;s ID so that
our Capybara test can find the checkbox using the pet&#39;s ID.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Finally, in between the opening and closing input tags, we use ERB to
render the given pet&#39;s name.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The result is a form that looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/create-owner-orig.png"></p>

<p>Let&#39;s place a <code>binding.pry</code> in the <code>post
&#39;/owners&#39;</code> route and submit our form so that we can get a
better understanding of the <code>params</code> hash we&#39;re creating
with our form. Once you hit your binding, type <code>params</code> in the
terminal, and you should see something like this:</p>

<pre class="ruby">{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;owner&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">&quot;Adele&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet_ids&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;1&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;2&quot;</span>]}}
</pre>

<p>I filled out my form with a name of “Adele”, and I checked the boxes for
“Maddy” and “Nona”. So, our <code>params</code> hash has a key of
<code>&quot;owner&quot;</code> that points to a value that is a hash
containing two keys: <code>&quot;name&quot;</code>, with a value of the
name entered into the form, and <code>&quot;pet_ids&quot;</code>, with a
value of an array containing the ids of all of the pets we selected via our
checkboxes. Let&#39;s move on to writing the code that will create a new
owner <em>and</em> associate it to these pets.</p>

<h4 id="label-Creating+New+Owners+with+Associated+Pets+in+the+Controller">Creating New Owners with Associated Pets in the Controller<span><a href="#label-Creating+New+Owners+with+Associated+Pets+in+the+Controller">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h4>

<p>We are familiar with using mass assignment to create new instances of a
class with Active Record. For example, if we had a hash,
<code>owner_info</code>, that looked like this…</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">owner_info</span> = {<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span><span class="ruby-operator">:</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Adele&quot;</span>}
</pre>

<p>…we could easily create a new owner like this:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">owner_info</span>)
</pre>

<p>But our <code>params</code> hash contains this additional key of
<code>&quot;pet_ids&quot;</code> pointing to an array of pet ID numbers.
You may be wondering if we can still use mass assignment here. Well, the
answer is yes. Active Record is smart enough to take that key of
<code>pet_ids</code>, pointing to an array of numbers, find the pets that
have those IDs, and associate them to the given owner, all because we set
up our associations such that an owner has many pets. Wow! Let&#39;s give
it a shot. Still in your Pry console that you entered via the
<code>binding.pry</code> in the <code>post &#39;/owners&#39;</code> action
of the <code>OwnersController</code>, type:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;owner&quot;</span>])
<span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; #&lt;Owner:0x007fdfcc96e430 id: 2, name: &quot;Adele&quot;&gt;</span>
</pre>

<p>It worked! Now, type:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">pets</span>
<span class="ruby-comment">#=&gt; [#&lt;Pet:0x007fb371bc22b8 id: 1, name: &quot;Maddy&quot;, owner_id: 2&gt;, #&lt;Pet:0x007fb371bc1f98 id: 2, name: &quot;Nona&quot;, owner_id: 2&gt;]</span>
</pre>

<p>And our usage of mass assignment successfully associated the new owner with
the pets whose ID numbers were in the <code>params</code> hash!</p>

<p>Now that we have this working code, let&#39;s go ahead and place it in our
<code>post &#39;/owners&#39;</code> action:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment"># app/controllers/owners_controller.rb</span>

<span class="ruby-identifier">post</span> <span class="ruby-string">&#39;/owners&#39;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">owner</span>])
  <span class="ruby-identifier">redirect</span> <span class="ruby-node">&quot;owners/#{@owner.id}&quot;</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>Great! We&#39;re almost done with this feature. But, remember that we want
a user to be able to create a new owner, select some existing pets to
associate with that owner, <em>and</em> also have the option of creating a
new pet to associate with that owner. Let&#39;s build that latter
capability into our form.</p>

<h4 id="label-Creating+a+New+Owner+and+Associating+Them+with+a+New+Pet">Creating a New <a href="Owner.html">Owner</a> and Associating Them with a New <a href="Pet.html">Pet</a><span><a href="#label-Creating+a+New+Owner+and+Associating+Them+with+a+New+Pet">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h4>

<p>This will be fairly simple. All we need to do is add a section to our form
for creating a new pet:</p>

<pre>and/or, create a new pet:
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;name:&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input  type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;pet[name]&quot;&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</pre>

<p>Now our whole form should look something like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;h1&gt;Create a new Owner&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;form action=&quot;/owners&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;owner[name]&quot; id=&quot;owner_name&quot;&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;label&gt;Choose an existing pet:&lt;/label&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;%Pet.all.each do |pet|%&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;owner[pet_ids][]&quot; id=&quot;&lt;%=pet.id%&gt;&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%=pet.id%&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;%=pet.name%&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
  &lt;%end%&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

    &lt;label&gt;and/or, create a new pet:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;name:&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input  type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;pet[name]&quot;&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Create Owner&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>

<p>Note that we&#39;ve included the section for creating a new pet at the
bottom of the form and we&#39;ve given that input field a <code>name</code>
of <code>pet[name]</code>. Now, if we fill out our form like this…</p>

<p><img src="http://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/creat-owner-two.png"></p>

<p>…when we submit our form, our <code>params</code> hash should look
something like this:</p>

<pre class="ruby">{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;owner&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">&quot;Adele&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet_ids&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;1&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;2&quot;</span>]}, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">&quot;Fake Pet&quot;</span>}}
</pre>

<p>Our <code>params["owner"]</code> hash is unchanged, so <code>@owner =
Owner.create(params["owner"])</code> still works. But what about creating
our new pet with a name of <code>&quot;Fake Pet&quot;</code> and
associating it to our new owner?</p>

<p>For this, we&#39;ll have to grab the new pet&#39;s name from
<code>params["pet"][&quot;name&quot;]</code>, use it to create a new pet,
and add the new pet to our new owner&#39;s collection of pets:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">pets</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Pet</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span><span class="ruby-operator">:</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet&quot;</span>][<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>])
</pre>

<p>But, you might be wondering, what if the user <em>does not</em> fill out
the field to name and create a new pet? In that case, our
<code>params</code> hash would look like this:</p>

<pre class="ruby">{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;owner&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">&quot;Adele&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet_ids&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;1&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;2&quot;</span>]}, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">&quot;&quot;</span>}}
</pre>

<p>The above line of code would create a new pet with a name of an empty
string and associate it to our owner. That&#39;s no good. We&#39;ll need a
way to control whether or not the above line of code runs. Let&#39;s create
an <code>if</code> statement to check whether or not the value of
<code>params["pet"][&quot;name&quot;]</code> is an empty string.</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">if</span> <span class="ruby-operator">!</span><span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet&quot;</span>][<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">empty?</span>
  <span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">pets</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Pet</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span><span class="ruby-operator">:</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet&quot;</span>][<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>])
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>That looks pretty good. Let&#39;s put it all together:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s sum up before we move on. We:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Built a form that dynamically generates checkboxes for each of the existing
pets.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Added a field to that form in which a user can fill out the name for a
brand new pet.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Built a controller action that uses mass assignment to create a new owner
and associate it to any existing pets that the user selected via
checkboxes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Added to that controller action code that checks to see if a user did in
fact fill out the form field to name and create a new pet. If so, our code
will create that new pet and add it to the newly-created owner&#39;s
collection of pets.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Now that we can create a new owner with associated pets, let&#39;s build
out the feature for editing that owner and their associated pets.</p>

<h3 id="label-Editing+Owners+and+Associated+Pets">Editing Owners and Associated Pets<span><a href="#label-Editing+Owners+and+Associated+Pets">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Our edit form will be very similar to our create form. We want a user to be
able to edit everything about an owner: the owner&#39;s name, any existing
pet associations, and any new pet the user would like to create and
associate with that owner. So, our form should have the standard,
pre-filled name field as well as dynamically generated checkboxes for
existing pets. This time, though, the checkboxes should be automatically
checked if the given owner already owns that pet. Finally, we&#39;ll need
the same form field we built earlier for a user to create a new pet to be
associated with our owner.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s do it!</p>

<pre># edit.erb
&lt;h1&gt;Update Owner&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;form action=&quot;/owners/&lt;%=@owner.id%&gt;&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;owner[name]&quot; id=&quot;owner_name&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%=@owner.name%&gt;&quot;&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;label&gt;Choose an existing pet:&lt;/label&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;%Pet.all.each do |pet|%&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;owner[pet_ids][]&quot; id=&quot;&lt;%= pet.id%&gt;&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%=pet.id%&gt;&quot; &lt;%=&#39;checked&#39; if @owner.pets.include?(pet) %&gt;&gt;&lt;%=pet.name%&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
  &lt;%end%&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;label&gt;and/or, create a new pet:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;name:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input  type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;pet[name]&quot; id=&quot;pet_name&quot;&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Update Owner&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>

<p>The main difference here is that we added the <code>checked</code> property
to each checkbox with a condition to test whether the given pet is already
present in the current owner&#39;s collection of pets. We implemented this
<code>if</code> statement by wrapping the <code>checked</code> attribute in
ERB tags, allowing us to use Ruby on our view page.</p>

<p>Go ahead and make some changes to your owner using this edit form, then
place a <code>binding.pry</code> in your <code>post
&#39;/owners/:id&#39;</code> action and submit the form. Once you hit your
binding, type <code>params</code> in the terminal.</p>

<p>I filled out my edit form like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/update-owner.png"></p>

<p>Notice that I&#39;ve unchecked the first two pets, Maddy and Nona, and
checked the next two pets.</p>

<p>My <code>params</code> hash consequently looks like this:</p>

<pre class="ruby">{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;owner&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">&quot;Adele&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet_ids&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;3&quot;</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&quot;4&quot;</span>]},
 <span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>{<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">&quot;Another New Pet&quot;</span>},
 <span class="ruby-string">&quot;splat&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[],
 <span class="ruby-string">&quot;captures&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;8&quot;</span>],
 <span class="ruby-string">&quot;id&quot;</span>=<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">&quot;8&quot;</span>}
</pre>

<h4 id="label-Updating+Owners+in+the+Controller">Updating Owners in the Controller<span><a href="#label-Updating+Owners+in+the+Controller">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h4>

<p>Let&#39;s update our owner with this new information. Just as Active Record
was smart enough to allow us to use mass assignment to not only create a
new owner but to associate that owner to the pets whose IDs were contained
in the <code>&quot;pet_ids&quot;</code> array, it is also smart enough to
allow us to update an owner in the same way. In our Pry console in the
terminal, let&#39;s execute the following:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">find</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>])
<span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">update</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">owner</span>])
</pre>

<p>Now, if we type <code>@owner.pets</code>, we&#39;ll see that the owner is
no longer associated to the pets with an ID of 1 or 2, but they are
associated to pets 3 and 4:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">pets</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; [#&lt;Pet:0x007fd511d5e560 id: 3, name: &quot;SBC&quot;, owner_id: 8&gt;,</span>
 <span class="ruby-comment">#&lt;Pet:0x007fd511d5e3d0 id: 4, name: &quot;Fake Pet&quot;, owner_id: 8&gt;]</span>
</pre>

<p>Great! Now, we need to implement logic similar to that in our <code>post
&#39;/owners&#39;</code> action to handle a user trying to associate a
brand new pet to our owner:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">post</span> <span class="ruby-string">&#39;/owners/:id&#39;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">find</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">id</span>])
  <span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">update</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;owner&quot;</span>])
  <span class="ruby-keyword">if</span> <span class="ruby-operator">!</span><span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet&quot;</span>][<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">empty?</span>
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@owner</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">pets</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Pet</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">create</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">name</span><span class="ruby-operator">:</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">params</span>[<span class="ruby-string">&quot;pet&quot;</span>][<span class="ruby-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>])
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">redirect</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">to</span> <span class="ruby-node">&quot;owners/#{@owner.id}&quot;</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>And that&#39;s it!</p>

<h3 id="label-Creating+and+Updating+Pets+with+Associated+Owners">Creating and Updating Pets with Associated Owners<span><a href="#label-Creating+and+Updating+Pets+with+Associated+Owners">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve walked through these features together for the
<code>Owner</code> model, take some time and try to build out the same
functionality for <code>Pet</code>. The form to create a new pet should
allow a user to select from the list of available owners and/or create a
new owner, and the form to edit a given pet should allow the user to select
a new owner or create a new owner. Note that if a new owner is created it
would override any existing owner that is selected.</p>

<p>Make sure you run the tests to check your work.</p>
